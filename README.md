# Password Generator Starter Code
This application utilizes JavaScript to generate a unique password for the user, which must consist of 8 to 128 characters. Users are given the freedom to choose whether they want to include uppercase characters, numbers, and/or special characters. Once all prompts are selected, the newly generated password is displayed. However, in case the user does not select any prompt, the website will prompt them to select at least one option.
